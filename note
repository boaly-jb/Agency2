I need a website designed for a commercial flooring maintenance company based in Texas. We will be providing services like carpet shampooing, burnishing, resurfacing and power washing. It needs to be cool and trendy.

I’ll need 10-20 pages. I need help deciding on the style and color palette. We will need great stock pictures of different flooring types and you will need to photo shop our logo on imaginary cars or storefronts.

Please have similar experience and an open mind. I’m looking for a partnership and someone to turn to for future projects and upkeep.
